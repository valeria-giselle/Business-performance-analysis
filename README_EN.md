## 📈 Results

The analysis of key business metrics — Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI),
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Retention Rate, and Customer Lifetime Value
(LTV) — revealed important patterns related to customer acquisition,
profitability, and long-term value across different advertising sources.

The results indicate that marketing investment decisions should prioritize
efficiency and profitability rather than simply increasing spending.

Based on the analysis, **Source 1** stands out as the most effective option for
continued investment, as it:
- Shows a positive ROMI, indicating a favorable financial return relative to
  marketing spend.
- Has a CAC lower than LTV, reflecting a sustainable acquisition model.
- Demonstrates a high conversion rate, showing an efficient transition from
  user registration to purchase.
- Maintains strong customer retention, contributing to higher long-term value.

In contrast, **Source 3** presents significant challenges:
- High acquisition costs and elevated CAC compared to other sources.
- Low profitability, where generated revenue does not justify marketing spend.
- Weak retention, limiting its contribution to long-term customer value.

To maximize marketing return, the following actions are recommended:
- Increase budget allocation toward high-ROMI sources with strong conversion
  and LTV performance.
- Reduce investment in channels with high CAC and low profitability.
- Implement retention strategies (loyalty programs, engagement campaigns) to
  increase LTV among existing customers.
- Continuously monitor key metrics to ensure acquisition efficiency and
  sustainable growth.
